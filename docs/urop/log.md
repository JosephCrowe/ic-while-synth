# Tuesday 18 August 2015

Considered how a number of example programs might be synthesised:

1. *Reduced row echelon form* of matrices with entries in Z/pZ, the field of integers modulo a prime number, using Gauss-Jordan elimination. An implementation (in Python) with structure equal to what I believe the synthesiser would need to produce is given [here](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/2a172aebfb037ce22c94e9a3909afca2dc4529e0/misc/gauss_jordan_modp.py).

2. The shortest path between two nodes in a directed graph (where each edge weight is taken to be 1), given by an ajacenecy matrix, using a depth-first search with iterative deepening. As above, a relevant Python implementation is given [here](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/2a172aebfb037ce22c94e9a3909afca2dc4529e0/misc/shortest_path.py).

3. The *transitive closure* of a relation given by the adjacency matrix of the corresponding directed graph. An implementation in While syntax is given [here]().

# Monday 17 August 2015

Implemented the ability to designate variables as *local* to a subroutine, meaning that they are saved to the stack whenever that subroutine calls another subroutine.

Looked in particular at the `ackermann` program, which computes `A(m,n)`, the Ackermann–Péter function, which is known to be computable but not primitive recursive, and produces large values very quickly.
* For `m, n <= 2`, the program can be run by the ASP interpreter, if a stack of size 7 and a time limit of 175 is allowed ([specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/be42bc0c5416c10eb63ce3279d3b14deada39a9a/examples/run/ackermann.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/be42bc0c5416c10eb63ce3279d3b14deada39a9a/examples_output/run/ackermann.output.txt)).
* For `m = n = 3`, the required stack size is 62 (or 59 with tail-call elimination), and the number of separate invocations to the Ackermann function would be 2432, meaning that at least 1000 time steps would be required, making it infeasible to run using the current simulator.
* For `m >= 4`, the values become impracticable even for an efficient programming language to compute.

Although it's possible to run the `ackermann` program, synthesising it is a different matter, since running a single instance takes on the order of 1 minute due to the large stack, and this would be multiplied many times when searching for the correct program.

A learning task for `ackermann` is nonetheless given [here](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/5d4e47acf37cf2ff32ac07c36ec9168d84263c83/examples/iterative/ackermann.lp). (It is specified with an ASP-syntax postcondition that calls a Lua function, since it's not currently easy to specify the Ackermann function in Haskell syntax such that a finite output is produced). It hangs for several minutes after finding the 4th counterexample, namely `A(2,0)`, and seeking a program with 4 lines.

However, if the domain of `m` and `n` is limited to the trivial case of `m, n <= 1`, this does obtain the linear function `A(m,n) = m + n + 1`, fitting these 4 inputs.

# Friday 14 August 2015

Partially implemented the ability to learn an arbitrary set of subroutines, possibly including `main`, given a precondition and postcondition for `main` and `line_limit_max` declarations for all but one of them. This uses an algorithm suggested by Mark Law where:

1. One subroutine (heuristically, the largest one) is learned iteratively starting from a small number of lines, while the rest start at the maximum number of lines, then:
2. In serial, the remaining subroutines are brought down to the minimum number of lines using Clingo optimisation statements (or possibly iterating downwards outside of Clingo), generating new counterexamples if necessary, so that minimality is achieved while preserving whole-program correctness.

Part 2 of the above remains to be fully implemented.

The system can be seen learning two subroutines at once in the following example, `code_swap`, where two integers `x` and `y`, encoded as a single integer `k=x+5y` are swapped using three subroutines:

* `decode` (not given), which obtains `x` and `y` from `k`;
* `swap` (given), which swaps `x` and `y`, and can be imagined to be present in the user's library of subroutines from a previous session; and
* `encode` (not given), which obtains the modified `k` from the modified `x` and `y`. 

The `main` subroutine is also given and simply calls the three in sequence. See the [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/8616f14fa2dc107ee5076d3c0a2c22c31fce7a7a/examples/iterative/code_swap.lp) and [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/8616f14fa2dc107ee5076d3c0a2c22c31fce7a7a/examples_output/iterative/code_swap.output.txt).

# Thursday 13 August 2015

Implemented the ability to learn a non-`main` subroutine given the implementation of `main` and a precondition and postcondition for `main`. For example, the `swap` subroutine can be learned with respect to a given `reverse` program here: [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/8616f14fa2dc107ee5076d3c0a2c22c31fce7a7a/examples/learn/swap_reverse.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/8616f14fa2dc107ee5076d3c0a2c22c31fce7a7a/examples_output/learn/swap_reverse.output.txt).

# Wednesday 12 August 2015

Implemented an optimisation to the ASP generated for the counterexample finder, affording a large performance increase at the cost of reducing the number of "expected output" sets shown to at most 1. Effects include:
* The previous `reverse` program can now be synthesised 3 times faster than previously, with fewer parts of the program given: [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/79967231d5ff061adbe35f09e88069172f5c06f7/examples/iterative/reverse_sub.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/79967231d5ff061adbe35f09e88069172f5c06f7/examples_output/iterative/reverse_sub.output.txt).
* The `array_find` program, which gives the index of the first occurrence of an element in an array, can be synthesised in comparable time to `reverse`: [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/79967231d5ff061adbe35f09e88069172f5c06f7/examples/iterative/array_find.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/79967231d5ff061adbe35f09e88069172f5c06f7/examples_output/iterative/array_find.output.txt).

Also made various cosmetic changes, including adding the `-t` flag to show the time taken by each subcomputation in the synthesiser (which can be seen in the above output examples).

Relevant commits: [7996723](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/79967231d5ff061adbe35f09e88069172f5c06f7)

# Tuesday 11 August 2015

Implemented an optimisation to the stage of the program synthesiser where Haskell-syntax preconditions and postconditions are evaluated, reducing the time taken at this stage by a factor of up to 12 in some observed cases. Partially implement a further improvement to the counterexample finder.

Also wrote a small utility, `Profile.hs`, to help with attributing the grounding size of an answer set program to specific predicates.

Relevant commits: [7996723](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/79967231d5ff061adbe35f09e88069172f5c06f7)

# Monday 10 August 2015

Resolved the previous issue with learning array programs using `IterativeLearn`. The `reverse` program can be seen successfully learned here: [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6150d166eaaa54aab29e9f49f44fa6f4c86763dd/examples/iterative/reverse_sub.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6150d166eaaa54aab29e9f49f44fa6f4c86763dd/examples_output/iterative/reverse_sub.lp).

Perhaps surprisingly, most of the synthesis time is taken at the beginning (when the precondition and postcondition are instantiated) and for the final counterexample-generation step. I believe that both of these delays can be addressed, but I will give further information if I'm unsuccessful.

Also implemented a more general parser for ASP syntax and made some other miscellaneous improvements.

Relevant commits: [6150d16](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/6150d166eaaa54aab29e9f49f44fa6f4c86763dd)

# Friday 07 August 2015

Starting making some further adaptations to the system to allow subroutine programs to be successfully learned with Haskell pre- and postconditions. The system is currently left in a partially working state due to an unidentified bug.

Relevant commits: [894d18b](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/894d18b8cb2c316ffb3ac46724eb229f5ea0dd30) [85f8690](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/85f8690bde091f4a4380a9f392e8b155cdd9e1cd)

# Thursday 06 August 2015

Implemented in `learn.lp` the ability to learn programs using subroutines (when the body of each subroutine is given), and in `Format.hs` the ability to print out such programs. This is not very thoroughly tested as yet, but works for the following trivial example, `swap_sub`: [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/086a38cbc7a87c864e0a75d1fad85c430ead7669/examples/learn/swap_sub.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/1c4406e7cc75190c0d51810e9fddd396ddd1b973/examples_output/learn/swap_sub.output.txt).

# Wednesday 05 August 2015

Implemented in the program simulator parameterless subroutines sharing the global variable scope, but with a fixed-size call stack to allow bounded recursion or for subroutines to depend on other subroutines. Wrote the example program `bubble_sort` to test it: [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/subroutines/examples/run/bubble_sort.lp), [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/subroutines/examples_output/run/bubble_sort.output.txt).

It is notable that it requires a large `int_max` to simulate this program, which would make simulation difficult; however, if the subroutines were accompanied by a pre/postcondition giving their functional specification, computation of subroutine calls might be done in only 1 time step.

The `arrays` branch has been merged back into `master` for now, with work on subroutines taking place on the new `subroutines` branch.

# Friday 31 July - Tuesday 04 August 2015

Fixed a number of issues with the the program synthesiser while trying out various examples. Added `array_max` and `array_find` example programs (example output: coming soon). The latter is notably slow to synthesise, and I am still looking into ways to improve it.

# Thursday 30 July 2015

Completed implementation of Haskell-syntax preconditions and postconditions in `IterativeLearn.hs`.

This allows, for example, the `array_sum` program to be learned without any user-provided examples. Only 3 examples are needed to generate the program, compared to the 8 examples used in the manual case. See the [specification file](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/a36979bad5056bca70428f5b8c510f1ab18bb118/examples/iterative/array_sum_con.lp) and [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/4b325520261f0c57e9fdad5becbdda1be6478192/examples_output/iterative/array_sum_con.output.txt). More examples will be shown as soon as I have a chance to run them.

Partially implemented support for Haskell-syntax preconditions and postconditions in `IterativeLearn.hs`.

A (manually written) example of the counterexample-generating ASP that it is planned to automatically generate can be seen in [`examples/misc/array_sum_counterexample.lp`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/74948faeeac1342420248ec95624576afb369bda/examples/misc/array_sum_counterexample.lp).

# Tuesday 28 July 2015

Partially implemented integration of the existing Haskell-to-ASP infrastructure into the program learner and counterexample finder. In particular, implemented:
* Synthesis of ASP rules, complete with arbitrary rule heads and variable domains, from classical propositions such as those generated from Haskell.
* A meta-Haskell interpreter that produces Abstract.Bool values (based on the [hint](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hint) package, which is itself based on GHC's API).
* Support for Arrays in `IterativeLearn.hs`. 

For minimal functionality, it remains to implement support for Haskell-based conditions in `IterativeLearn.hs`. Further, it wll be necessary to implement support for arrays and Haskell conditions in `TemplateLearn.hs`.

Relevant commits: [67447c1](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/67447c120fac322480c64cadbf9b70a6f130a649) [19f4542](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/19f4542a9acd0da4cd6446f7fed1abec7f12d688) [77bba19](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/77bba1902956464874a14221de8c97092f48e177)

# Monday 27 July 2015

Implemented an algorithm to convert from Haskell-generated boolean expression abstracted over variables to disjunctions of ASP rule bodies.

This is best demonstrated at the moment by showing a Haskell interpreter session:
```
> let toASP = mapM_ print . propToBodies . boolToPropASP -- helper function
> let (z, xs) = ("Z", ["X1".."X3"])      -- variables in our domain
> toASP $ z == max (xs !! 0) (xs !! 1)   -- maximum of two elements
Z == X1, X1 >= X2
Z == X2, X1 < X2
> toASP $ all (z >=) xs && any (z ==) xs -- maximum of N elements
Z == X1, Z >= X1, Z >= X2, Z >= X3
Z == X2, Z >= X1, Z >= X2, Z >= X3
Z == X3, Z >= X1, Z >= X2, Z >= X3
```
For the above examples it works nicely, but there are problems with redundant clauses being introduced: for example, using the standard `maximum` function instead of the custom version above, a disjunct is generated for every possible ordering of the array:
```
> toASP $ z == maximum xs
Z == X1, X1 >= X2, X1 >= X3
Z == X1, X1 >= X2, X1 >= X3, X2 >= X3
Z == X2, X1 < X2, X1 >= X3, X2 >= X3
Z == X2, X1 < X2, X2 >= X3
Z == X3, X1 < X2, X2 < X3
Z == X3, X1 < X3, X1 >= X2
```
In order to deal with this, either some stronger simplifications need to be applied to the output, or use of functions like `maximum` that cause a lot of logical branching must be discouraged in favour of the `any`/`all` approach.

This completes parts 1 and 3 of the task outlined in the [Thursday 23 July](#thursday-23-july-2015) entry, leaving part 4 yet to be completed. After this, it will also be necessary to integrate the new system with the existing program synthesiser to fully automate this process.

# Friday 24 July 2015

Implemented in the program learner `learn.lp` the ability to annotate the variables and constants of a program with **types**. Each type represents a region of memory, say, within which data flow is restricted. Moreoever, it is possible for these regions to overlap where an element inhabits more than one type, allowing controlled data flow through the program. This generalises the previously suggested notion of designating certain variables as array "pointers."

More specifically, zero or more *types*, represented as atoms, are assigned by the user to each variable, constant, array's elements and array's indices. Programs which contain an expression, assignment or array index where the involved types are *disjoint*, i.e. there is no type common to the type-sets being unified, are statically constrained out of the search space. An element with no user-defined types, or with the type `any`, implicitly inhabits *all* types, including the `any` type if this is not explicitly written by the user.

The current implementation has immediate performance benefits; for example, the `array_sum` program annoted with types to segregate array indices from array elements, specified [here](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6aa42be55ca02b9a1ae0010e2ce21e0f138e2b1a/examples/learn/array_sum_typ.lp) with output [here](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6aa42be55ca02b9a1ae0010e2ce21e0f138e2b1a/examples_output/learn/array_sum_typ.output.txt), improves on the untyped version by halving the grounding size (of the final iteration) and reducing the total synthesis time by a factor of 2.5:

`array_sum`   | Grounding size | Synthesis time
--------------|---------------:|---------------:
Without types |        1028433 |       146.660s
With types    |         472419 |        59.075s

Specifying types also has benefits insofar as ensuring a sensibly-structured program, exemplified by the fact that, for a particular set of human-chosen examples, the `array_max` program specified [here](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6aa42be55ca02b9a1ae0010e2ce21e0f138e2b1a/examples/learn/array_max_typ.lp) with types synthesises the [correct program](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6aa42be55ca02b9a1ae0010e2ce21e0f138e2b1a/examples_output/learn/array_max_typ.output.txt), while its untyped version with the same examples results in the [wrong program](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/6aa42be55ca02b9a1ae0010e2ce21e0f138e2b1a/examples_output/learn/array_max.output.txt) (counterexample: `[1,3,6]`). It is expected that when combined with a counterexample-generator supporting arrays, type-annotation will reduce the number of examples needed to synthesise the correct program..

# Thursday 23 July 2015

Completed implementation of `Abstract.Bool` and `Abstract.Int` Haskell data types, which allow boolean and integer expressions abstracted over named variables to be constructed from Haskell expressions, including those involving lists (nominally completed; it may be found that further definitions are needed to make it useful in practice).

Started implementing the transformation from `Abstract.Bool` expressions to ASP syntax. The transformation involves multiple stages:

  1. Convert an `Abstract.Bool` expression into a classical proposition whose *atoms* are arithmetic expressions. I have defined the type `Prop` in [`Logic.hs`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/arrays/main/Logic.hs) to this end. The transformation is slightly nontrivial where `if` expressions are involved, but I have an algorithm in mind for this

  2. Put the proposition into Disjunctive Normal Form. The function [`pToDNF`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/bbe952099168ad6f67223a9a7172bd0438700f35/main/Logic.hs#L49) in `Logic.hs` implements this.

  3. Convert each arithmetic expression in the DNF into ASP syntax (i.e. the type [`Expr`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/bbe952099168ad6f67223a9a7172bd0438700f35/main/ASP.hs#L37) in `ASP.hs`). This will be relatively easy, by construction of the type `Abstract.Int`, unless it's chosen to apply arithmetic simplification.

  4. Make each disjunct of the DNF into an ASP constraint whose conjuncts correspond to the (possibly negated) conjuncts in the disjunct; add appropriate domain predicates to each constraint so that each variable is properly bound.

It may also be necessary or desired to apply logical/arithmetical simplification at various points, to reduce the complexity of the generated code.

Relevant commits: [bbe9520](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/bbe952099168ad6f67223a9a7172bd0438700f35)

# Wednesday 22 July 2015

Investigated various ways of expressing facts about arrays in the condition language in a way usable in Clingo. I have settled for now on writing them in Haskell's syntax, as with curried functions and its reasonably extensive standard `List` library it seems well-suited for concisely expressing list transformations.

Firstly, I concluded that it will be necessary to instantiate a condition once for each possible combination of lengths of the involved arrays. This is because there is no way to express variable-length structures in ASP that would generate a smaller grounding. In particular, fixing the array sizes for all examples and allowing some array elements to be "unset" would generate a larger grounding due to the possible "holes" in the array. Therefore, it remains to express facts about fixed-length arrays.

I can see  several ways this could be implemented, and I ran some benchmarks to get an idea of their feasibility:

 # |Description | Time taken to solve over 46656 values
---|------------|------------------------------------------
1 | **Using Clingo's Lua scripting** interface, **run a compiled Haskell binary** which takes free variables as command-line argments, evaluates a predicate, and yields its truth value in the process's exit code. As you might expect, most of the time was taken in creating and destroying processes, so this is not tenable. | 195.266s
2 | As #1, but **keep the process open throughout grounding** and communicate through pipes/files. This is a respectable improvement, but because of limitations in Lua's standard library, it will be difficult to make it both reliable and cross-platform compatible. | 3.917s
3 | **Allow conditions to be written natively as Lua functions** rather than calling an external process. This is even more of an improvement, but Lua's syntax is not very nice at all for concisely writing predicates. | 1.701s
4 | Rather than relying on Gringo, **generate the ground constraints** corresponding to the condition **directly in Haskell**, then (if needed) include them in an ASP for further processing. The logic in the counterexample-finder is simple enough that it might be possible to eliminate altogether the need for ASP in this component. However, this would likely suffer from scalability issues for larger domains that Clingo can more intelligently mitigate. | 0.743s
5 | **Translate Haskell boolean expressions directly into ASP** constraint bodies, allowing the associated grounding to only accumulate in one place, and also allowing simplifying transformations to be made at the same time. The benchmark given here is based on a hypothetical, manually-written transformation from Haskell into ASP; but it seems if this were successful, it could afford a great performance benefit.  | 0.007s

\#5 seemed like the potentially most promising way of proceeding, so I spent some time thinking about how it might be achieved. Using Haskell's parametric polymorphism and GHC's [`RebindableSyntax`](https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/7.6.3/docs/html/users_guide/syntax-extns.html#rebindable-syntax) extension, it is possible in Haskell to redefine arithmetic and boolean operators (and some other Prelude functions) so that evaluating a boolean expression results in an **abstract syntax tree** representing a boolean expression over arithmetic expressions over integer variables. This could then be mechanically translated into ASP. This is the same idea used by [simple-reflect](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/simple-reflect), but takes it further insofar as making the result computationally useful.

I started writing [`Abstract.hs`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/arrays/main/Abstract.hs) which implements this idea. To show how it is useful, consider the following example, which uses a `Show` instance to print closed-form string representations of computations abstracted over named variables:
```
*Abstract> let xs = [IVar "X0", IVar "X1", IVar "X2", IVar "X3", IVar "X4"]
*Abstract> xs
[X0,X1,X2,X3,X4]
*Abstract> reverse xs
[X4,X3,X2,X1,X0]
*Abstract> sum xs
0 + X0 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4
*Abstract> sum xs == product xs
0 + X0 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4 == 1 * X0 * X1 * X2 * X3 * X4
```
The inputs, such as `sum xs`, are what the user would write, and the output `0 + X0 + X1 + X2 + X3 + X4` are what the ASP solver would receive.

# Tuesday 21 July 2015

Implemented learning of array programs from discrete examples, but not yet with the ability to generate such examples. Example programs:
* `array_last`: the last element in an array; [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/a4e55ab614f8867fd2f44751fa56aaf7c2af3979/examples/learn/array_last.lp) and [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/a4e55ab614f8867fd2f44751fa56aaf7c2af3979/examples_output/learn/array_last.output.txt).
* `array_sum`: the sum of array elements; [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/eee18892fc2b56e55d291a4d73dd2cea34145a26/examples/learn/array_sum.lp) and [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/eee18892fc2b56e55d291a4d73dd2cea34145a26/examples_output/learn/array_sum.output.txt).

A problem with supporting arrays in the counterexample-finder is that it would be necessary to be able to express facts about arrays in the pre/postcondition language. This could be done by representing arrays as linked lists, but the grounding size is likely to be large when such lists are used in a lot of places. It may be better to use dynamically-generated predicates of variable arity, which are inlined when possible, or something else.

# Monday 20 July 2015

* Implemented a support for a form of statically-allocated arrays in the program simulator. [`run.lp`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/3cbbeed190492f8f964dc7a235cadc9518b97ad8/main/run.lp) contains commentary on the syntax and semantics decided so far. An example is given by the [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/3cbbeed190492f8f964dc7a235cadc9518b97ad8/examples/run/array_sum.lp) and [output](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/3cbbeed190492f8f964dc7a235cadc9518b97ad8/examples_output/run/array_sum.output.txt) of running a program that finds the sum of the elements in a given array, when its (variable) length is given in the variable `n`. This work will take place on the `arrays` branch until it is deemed ready to merge with the main codebase.

* Fixed some minor concurrency issues in `IterativeLearn.hs`, allowing the `--echo-asp` option to now be usefully used with `--threads=N` for `N > 1`. These changes will also make it easier to make other improvements to the user interface.

# Friday 10 July 2015

Mostly experimented and thought of ways to improve the synthesiser, and ways to reason about its correctness. Came up with some ideas that could acted upon, which I have written up in (some) detail in [issue #4](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/issues/4). 

I hope to explain the more clearly after I've had more time to think about it.

# Thursday 9 July 2015

Implemented an algorithm to propagate information from later to earlier conditions in a template, fixing [issue #2](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/issues/2). Also added a user-readable display of the template in its various stages to the program output.

* The `diff` program used to motivate the problem can now be synthesised from the [original template](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/28d9ffea1d5f4287afe2c611cdf6b7c0e5f7dd7d/examples/template/diff.lp), and produces the [desired program](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/28d9ffea1d5f4287afe2c611cdf6b7c0e5f7dd7d/examples_output/template/diff.output.txt).

* A more substantial example can be seen in the `gcd` program, which now requires a rather less complex [specification](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/28d9ffea1d5f4287afe2c611cdf6b7c0e5f7dd7d/examples/template/gcd.lp) to produce the [correct program](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/28d9ffea1d5f4287afe2c611cdf6b7c0e5f7dd7d/examples_output/template/gcd.output.txt).

Of interest in both of the above examples might be the output at the beginning which shows the template being transformed from the format given by the user.

# Wednesday 8 July 2015

Implemented transformation of templates containing (in)variants to templates containing just midconditions,  consequently allowing the user the specify their templates with less work.

For example, the program `aliquot` which classifies numbers as prime (indicated by `t=0`), deficient and nonprime (`t=1`), perfect (`t=2`) or excessive (`t=3`) based on their Aliquot sum, the sum of their proper divisors, is specified in [`examples/template/aliquot.lp`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/d222461083763a7e477b119fd1d68a564c10a6e6/examples/template/aliquot.lp), and produces a correct but difficult to read program in [`examples_output/template/aliquot.output.txt`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/d222461083763a7e477b119fd1d68a564c10a6e6/examples_output/template/aliquot.output.txt).

I suspect that the problem of correct but bizarre programs being synthesised could be mitigated by requiring them to be minimal (or close to minimal) in other senses than just the line number, for example in the set of constants used. This could also make synthesis faster, and easier for the user.

I also noticed a problem with the counterexample finder generating examples that impose unreasonable requirements on the program synthesiser, which is filed as [issue #3](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/issues/3).

# Tuesday 7 July 2015

Implemented a new internal format for program skeletons (using a tree instead of a flat representation, for easier manipulation; supporting more helpful error messages; and with some minor changes also to the user-written representation).

Relevant commits: [50c4e4e](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/50c4e4e26a40ccad880e9760d51a7d51fff4aeae) [530626b](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/commit/530626b846bb5aafe1099536f90b30d202b48dc5)

# Monday 6 July 2015

Reworked much of how counterexamples are handled by the synthesiser, allowing non-injective postconditions to be used, i.e. those that allow more than one output per input. Consequently, programs annotated with loop variants and invariants can now be synthesised, although these must currently be expanded manually into the corresponding midcondition.

For example the `gcd` program, which computes the greatest common divisor of 2 integers, specified at [`examples/template/gcd.lp`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/48dff02d1456263c09149eb18c6a0ccfa243578b/examples/template/gcd.lp), uses the GCD of its two working variables as an invariant quantity, and the size of one as a variant, and produces the output at [`examples_output/template/gcd.output.txt`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/53fb8fc6393e87187f66fbf5bee62148546e5a29/examples_output/template/gcd.output.txt). This program synthesises in 5-10 seconds, compared to ~1 minute with just pre/postconditions.

Currently thinking about the best way to augment the midconditions given by the user to take full advantage of the information available. This would might include automatically determining loop in/variants, or performing case analysis on if statements, or augmenting midconditions with information from previous ones, as detailed in [issue #2](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/issues/2).

# Friday 3 July 2015

Made a working implementation of a synthesiser, TemplateLearn.hs, capable of reading a program specification including midconditions (but not while loop bodies/variants/invariants), and synthesising the program piecewise by calling IterativeLearn.hs.

An example of this working is the program `max` which computes the maximum of 5 integers. The specification using midconditions is given in [`examples/template/max.lp`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/481e9856aa7daefc56002834128004dee49ede81/examples/template/max.lp) and the output in [`examples_output/template/max.output.txt`](https://github.com/JosephCrowe/ic-while-synth/blob/890593307ed9082ae7faae994e0be0a6e7169f9d/examples_output/template/max.output.txt).

Started preparing further changes that will allow while loop bodies to be separately synthesised.
