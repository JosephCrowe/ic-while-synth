\section{Introduction}

We shall address the problem of automatically writing computer programs in an 
imperative programming language (see section~\ref{sec:outlng}, While Language) 
given a specification of the program's behaviour written in a simple, abstract language 
understandable by users without programming expertise.

In particular, we have examined the notion of allowing the specification to consist of 
a finite set of input/output pairs that the generated program should satisfy (see 
section~\ref{sec:inplng}, Specification Language).

As a simple example, the following specification:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output}
\\  $x = 0$        & $y = 0$
\\  $x = 1$        & $y = 2$
\\  $x = 2$        & $y = 4$
\\  $x = 3$        & $y = 6$
\end{tabular}

is one that many programs could satisfy (there is an $n$-degree polynomial for each 
integer $n \geq 3$ which interpolates these points), but the program which the user 
probably has in mind, and that which we would hope to automatically synthesise, being a 
``simplest'' program in some sense, is:

\begin{algorithmic}[H]
\State $y \gets x + x$
\end{algorithmic}

This has possible applications in Computing education: a teacher with students who are 
learning how to program may wish to generate \emph{multiple} different programs, one 
for each student, to be used by the student in an exercise by extending, analysing the 
behaviour of, etc. If the teacher is able to quickly generate these multiple programs 
without spending the time to write each one, this task becomes much more scalable in 
the number of students.

Another application is in data processing software tools (such as spreadsheets) whose 
users are likely to be non-programmers, but whose usefulness could be greatly increased 
by the automation of complex data processing tasks, representable as computer programs, 
which could be specified by the user as a list of input/output examples.

In previous work, this problem has been approached in many different ways, 
and several systems have been built which are capable of synthesising 
programs in this manner, but the problem has not in its full generality 
been resolved. We hope to gain an insight into this by approaching it with 
new tools and techniques.

This can be viewed as a machine-learning problem, where the program generator 
\emph{learns} the correct program by considering examples of its behaviour. Since the 
discrete and exacting nature of computer programming seems to lend itself well to a 
logic-based learning approach, we ask whether the paradigm of Inductive Logic 
Programming (ILP)\cite{muggleton94} is well-suited to solve this problem. More 
specifically, our working implementation consists of an Answer Set Program run using 
tools from the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection\cite{potassco} (see 
section~\ref{sec:asp}, Answer Set Programming).

\section{Background}

\subsection{Answer Set Programming} \label{sec:asp}

Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a form of logic programming particularly 
suited to search problems over large domains (such as the domain of all 
imperative programs of a given length). An Answer Set Program 
distinguishes the result to be computed by a set of propositional facts 
and rules in the domain. Importantly, ASP includes \emph{negation as 
failure}, where a rule can be conditional on the inability of prove that 
some proposition is true, which allows \emph{non-monotonic reasoning}. The 
result of running an ASP is an \emph{answer set} of facts which is 
consistent with the program, forms a \emph{stable model}, and is minimal 
in a certain sense. For further details, see \cite{glimpse}, which gives a 
concise introduction to the paradigm.

ASP was used in 2014 by Muggleton et al.\cite{metagol} as one of two 
approaches to learning finite automata from positive and negative example 
sentences from the formal language the automata is desired to represent. 
In solving this problem in ASP (and in ILP in general), it was found to be 
necessary to implement \emph{predicate invention} by building a logical 
\emph{meta-interpreter} in the host language.

As another example of ASP's usage, Mark Law et al.\ in 2014 developed a 
system called ILASP\cite{ilasp} implementing a form of ILP where an Answer 
Set Program representing the solution is learned inductively from positive 
and negative examples, with applications in agent planning.

\section{Current Work}

We have begun development of a utility, based on the Potassco\cite{potassco} 
tools for Answer Set Programming, which reads a user-written specification 
including a language bias and test examples, and produces imperative programs 
in a simple ``While'' language.

\subsection{While Language} \label{sec:outlng}

The following context-free grammar gives the (abstract) syntax of the While 
language. The basic elements of a program are (at the moment) integer 
constants and named variables. The exact set of possible constants and 
variables is specific to the program being generated, is given by the language 
bias.
\begin{align*}
   \trm{Const} \to\ & ... \mid -2 \mid -1 \mid 0 \mid 1 \mid 2 \mid ...
\\ \trm{Var}   \to\ & a \mid b \mid c \mid ... \mid x \mid y \mid z \mid ...
\end{align*}
A While program is a possible empty sequence of \emph{commands}, where a 
\emph{command} assigns a value to a variable, or takes the form of an \ttt{if} 
or \ttt{while} statement with a boolean guard and a further sequence of 
commands:
\begin{align*}
   \trm{Prog}  \to\ & \trm{Cmds}
\\ \trm{Cmds}  \to\ & \varepsilon \mid \trm{Cmd} \ttt{; } \trm{Cmds}
\\ \trm{Cmd}   \to\ & \trm{Var} \ \ttt{=} \ \trm{Expr}
\\            \mid\ & \ttt{if (} \trm{Bool} \ttt{) \char`\{\ } \trm{Cmds} \ttt{ \char`\}}
\\            \mid\ & \ttt{while (} \trm{Bool} \ttt{) \char`\{\ } \trm{Cmds} \ttt{ \char`\}}
\end{align*}
An arithmetic expression is a sum, difference, product, or integer quotient of 
two constants and/or variables. A boolean guard can test the relation 
less-than ($<$) or less-than-or-equal ($\leq$) on constants and variables. The 
structure of expressions is deliberately kept as simple as possible, to reduce 
the search space of programs:
\begin{align*}
   \trm{Expr}  \to\ & \trm{LExpr}\ (\ \ttt{+} \mid \ttt{-} \mid \ttt{*} \mid \ttt{/}\ )\ \trm{LExpr}
\\ \trm{Bool}  \to\ & \trm{LExpr}\ (\ \ttt{<} \mid \ttt{<=}\ )\ \trm{LExpr}
\\ \trm{LExpr} \to\ & \trm{Const} \mid \trm{Var}
\end{align*}
Input and output is achieved by setting the initial values of certain 
\emph{input variables} before the program runs, and reading the values of 
certain \emph{output variables} after it has terminated.

The semantics of a While program are the same as C programs with the same 
syntax, except:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Execution starts at the first command of the program, and ends when 
    the last command has been executed.
    \item All variables exist in the same global scope throughout the 
    execution of the program.
    \item Except for input variables, the initial value of every variable is 0.
    \item The results of arithmetical operations wrap around so that all 
    values remain within the range of possible integer constants. This is done 
    mainly to reduce the complexity of simulating programs using ASP.
    \item Division by zero causes the program to formally not terminate.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Program Interpreter}

We have written in ASP an interpreter for the While language which, given 
facts specifying the initial values of input variables and the contents of 
each \emph{line} of the program, includes in the answer set facts saying 
(among other things) whether the program terminated, and if it did, what the 
final values of the output variables are.

The interpreter is capable of running at multiple traces of execution at once, 
each with possibly different input values, so the relevant facts about 
execution are also parameterised by a \emph{run identifier}. This 
functionality is essential to be able to learn programs that satisfy at once 
multiple test examples, as will be seen in section~\ref{sec:prgsyn}, Program 
Synthesiser.

The following facts specify a program which has an input variable $x$, and 
computes $z = \textrm{Fib}(x)$, the $x$th Fibonacci number, and also specifies 
6 different runs to perform:
\begin{verbatim}
    #const line_max=6.      % Maximum line number.
    var(x). var(y). var(z). % All variables used.
    
    line_instr(1, set(z, con(1))).               % z = 1;
    line_instr(2, while(lt(con(1), var(x)), 3)). % while (1 < x) {
    line_instr(3, set(z, add(var(y), var(z)))).  %    z = y + z;
    line_instr(4, set(y, sub(var(z), var(y)))).  %    y = z - y;
    line_instr(5, set(x, sub(var(x), con(1)))).  %    x = x - 1;
    line_instr(6, end_while).                    % }
    
    % Run the program with 6 different initial values of x:
    in(r1,x,1). in(r2,x,2). in(r3,x,3).
    in(r4,x,4). in(r5,x,5). in(r6,x,6).
\end{verbatim}
The second parameter of the function symbol \texttt{while/2} gives the 
length of its body, i.e.\ the number of instructions it contains, 
excluding the \ttt{while} and \ttt{end\_while} lines.

When run with the While interpreter, this produces an answer set including the 
following facts:
\begin{verbatim}
    run_var_out(r1,x,1) run_var_out(r1,y,0) run_var_out(r1,z,1) 
    run_var_out(r2,x,1) run_var_out(r2,y,1) run_var_out(r2,z,1) 
    run_var_out(r3,x,1) run_var_out(r3,y,1) run_var_out(r3,z,2) 
    run_var_out(r4,x,1) run_var_out(r4,y,2) run_var_out(r4,z,3)
    run_var_out(r5,x,1) run_var_out(r5,y,3) run_var_out(r5,z,5)
    run_var_out(r6,x,1) run_var_out(r6,y,5) run_var_out(r6,z,8) 
\end{verbatim}
The first column gives the final value of $x$ for each run and is not 
interesting, as this is just always 1 (or less), by the loop's guard. The 
second and third columns gives the final values of $y$ and $z$, and we can see 
that, as we hoped, $z=\textrm{Fib}(x_0)$ and $y=\textrm{Fib}(x_0-1)$, where 
$x_0$ is the initial value of $x$ for run $r_{x_0}$.

\subsection{Program Synthesiser} \label{sec:prgsyn}

The example in the previous section shows how the program interpreter 
works, but it is not how the system is intended to be used. In actuality, 
the user specifies what the output values should be for various inputs, 
and the solver abducts a program satisfying those constraints.

This is achieved by including an aggregate defining the domain of 
admissable programs, and integrity constraints to enforce the test 
examples:
\begin{verbatim}
    % Exactly one instruction per line.
    1{ line_instr(L, I) : valid_line_instr(L, I) }1 :- line(L).
    
    valid_line_instr(L, set(V, E))      :- line(L), write_var(V), expr(E).
    valid_line_instr(L, if(B, 1..M))    :- line(L), bool(B), M=line_max-L.
    valid_line_instr(L, while(B, 1..M)) :- line(L), bool(B), M=line_max-L-1.
    valid_line_instr(L, end_while)      :- line(L).
    
    % All test examples must halt with the correct value.
    :- run_does_not_halt(R).
    :- run_var_out(R,X,Actual), out(R,X,Expected), Actual != Expected.
\end{verbatim}
The predicate \ttt{out/3} is the counterpart to \ttt{in/3}, which was 
earlier used to specify the values of input variables, that asserts what 
the final value of a certain variable must be. The predicate 
\ttt{run\_does\_not\_halt/1} holds when a given run exceeds the time 
limit, or for some other reason does not formally terminate (e.g.\ when 
division by zero occurs). Further integrity constraints are included that 
ensure the generated program has a sensible structure, but for the sake of 
brevity are not shown here.

If we fix some facts in addition to the main program that includes the 
above machinery, we can immediately synthesise some simple programs:
\begin{verbatim}
    #const line_max=1.  % Number of lines.
    #const int_max=10.  % Maximum integer value.

    % Allowed explicit constants, variables, and writable variables:
    con(1). con(2). var(x). var(y). write_var(y).
    
    % Test examples:
    in(r0,x,0). out(r0,y,0).
    in(r1,x,1). out(r1,y,2).
    in(r2,x,2). out(r2,y,4).
    in(r3,x,3). out(r3,y,6).
\end{verbatim}
The answer set of which includes:
\begin{verbatim}
    line_instr(1,set(y,add(var(x),var(x))))
\end{verbatim}
Which is the program we expected, $y \gets x + x$.

As a slightly less trivial example, we can make the following 
specification of a program that computes $y = \sum_{i=0}^x i$, the $x$th 
triangular number:
\begin{verbatim}
    #const line_max=4.
    #const int_max=11. 
    con(1). var(x). var(y). write_var(x). write_var(y).
    
    in(r0,x,0). out(r0,y,0).
    in(r1,x,1). out(r1,y,1).
    in(r2,x,2). out(r2,y,3).
    in(r3,x,3). out(r3,y,6).
    in(r4,x,4). out(r4,y,10).
\end{verbatim}
This program is solved in 12 seconds on a 3.4GHz machine, yielding:
\begin{verbatim}
line_instr(1,while(le(con(1),var(x)),2)) % while (1 <= x) {
line_instr(2,set(y,add(var(x),var(y))))  %    y = x + y
line_instr(3,set(x,sub(var(x),con(1))))  %    x = x - 1
line_instr(4,end_while)                  % }
\end{verbatim}
Which is easily verified to generalise the examples in the intended way.

\subsection{Specification Language} \label{sec:inplng}
For longer and more complicated programs, it is currently necessary to cut 
down the search space by enforcing stronger constraints on the structure 
or contents of the programs. These are currently specified in the same 
syntax as the ASP program, but it would not be difficult to devise a more 
user-friendly format.

To make it easier to interpret the output of the system, we have a utility 
that converts relevant parts of the answer set into a more traditional 
human-readable listing of the program it represents. Another utility 
automates an incremental search for the smallest possible program, by 
first trying to find a program of 1 line, then incrementing the number of 
lines after each failure until a solution is found.

Following are some examples of inputs to the system and their 
corresponding output, illustrating its full functionality.

We can compute the median of three input values:
\begin{verbatim}
    #const time_max=line_max+1.
    #const int_max=8.
    var(a). var(b). var(c). var(y). var(z).
    write_var(y). write_var(z).
    
    % Omit from the search space some features we know are not needed:
    while_not_allowed.
    arithmetic_not_allowed.
    
    % Predefine the first three lines of the program, to help the solver:
    preset_line_instr(1, set(y, var(a))).
    preset_line_instr(2, if(lt(var(y), var(b)), 1)).
    preset_line_instr(3, set(y, var(b))).
    
    % Examples given in shorthand: ex(r, a,b,c, z).
    ex(r0, 0,0,0, 0).
    ex(r1, 7,1,1, 1). ex(r5, 1,7,1, 1). ex(r9, 1,1,7, 1).
    ex(r2, 1,7,7, 7). ex(r6, 7,1,7, 7). ex(rA, 7,7,1, 7).
    ex(r3, 1,2,3, 2). ex(r7, 1,3,2, 2). ex(rB, 2,1,3, 2).
    ex(r4, 3,2,1, 2). ex(r8, 2,3,1, 2). ex(rC, 3,1,2, 2).
\end{verbatim}
This program is solved in 44 seconds on a 3.4GHz machine, yielding:
\begin{verbatim}
   1. y = a
   2. if (y < b):
   3.     y = b
   4. if (c < b):
   5.     y = b
   6.     z = a
   7. if (z < c):
   8.     z = c
   9. if (y <= z):
  10.     z = y
\end{verbatim}
Which can be verified to indeed compute $z = \textrm{median}(a,b,c) = 
\textrm{min}(\textrm{max}(a,b), \textrm{max}(b,c), \textrm{max}(c,a))$.

Finally, the earlier Fibonacci program can be learned from test examples, 
when some help is given with the program structure:
\begin{verbatim}
    #const time_max=30.
    #const int_max=10.
    con(1). var(x). var(y). var(z).
    write_var(x). write_var(y). write_var(z).
    
    % Predefine the looping structure of the program,
    % and forbid the solver from generating any further structure:
    preset_line_instr(2, while(lt(con(1), var(x)), line_max-3)).
    preset_line_instr(line_max, end_while).
    
    if_not_allowed. while_not_allowed.
    
    in(r1,x,1). out(r1,z,1).  in(r2,x,2). out(r2,z,1).
    in(r3,x,3). out(r3,z,2).  in(r4,x,4). out(r4,z,3).
    in(r5,x,5). out(r5,z,5).  in(r6,x,6). out(r6,z,8).
\end{verbatim}
This solves in 113 seconds on a 3.4GHz machine, yielding:
\begin{verbatim}
   1. z = 1
   2. while (1 < x):
   3.     z = y + z
   4.     x = x - 1
   5.     y = z - y
   6. end_while
\end{verbatim}
As expected.
