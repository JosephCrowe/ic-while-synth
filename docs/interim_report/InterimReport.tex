\section{Introduction}

We shall address the problem of automatically writing computer programs in an 
imperative programming language (see section~\ref{sec:outlng}, While Language) 
given a specification of the program's behaviour written in a simple, abstract language 
understandable by users without programming expertise.

In particular, we have examined the notion of allowing the specification to consist of 
a finite set of input/output pairs that the generated program should satisfy (see 
section~\ref{sec:inplng}, Specification Language).

As a simple example, the following specification:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output}
\\  $x = 0$        & $y = 0$
\\  $x = 1$        & $y = 2$
\\  $x = 2$        & $y = 4$
\\  $x = 3$        & $y = 6$
\end{tabular}

is one that many programs could satisfy (there is an $n$-degree polynomial for each 
integer $n \geq 3$ which interpolates these points), but the program which the user 
probably has in mind, and that which we would hope to automatically synthesise, being a 
``simplest'' program in some sense, is:

\begin{algorithmic}[H]
\State $y \gets x + x$
\end{algorithmic}

This has possible applications in Computing education: a teacher with students who are 
learning how to program may wish to generate \emph{multiple} different programs, one 
for each student, to be used by the student in an exercise by extending, analysing the 
behaviour of, etc. If the teacher is able to quickly generate these multiple programs 
without spending the time to write each one, this task becomes much more scalable in 
the number of students.

Another application is in data processing software tools (such as spreadsheets) whose 
users are likely to be non-programmers, but whose usefulness could be greatly increased 
by the automation of complex data processing tasks, representable as computer programs, 
which could be specified by the user as a list of input/output examples.

In previous work, this problem has been approached in many different ways, and several 
systems have been built which are capable of synthesising programs in this manner (see 
section~\ref{sec:prgsyn}, Related Work in Synthesis), but the problem has not in its 
full generality been resolved. We hope to gain an insight into this by approaching it 
with new tools and techniques.

This can be viewed as a machine-learning problem, where the program generator 
\emph{learns} the correct program by considering examples of its behaviour. Since the 
discrete and exacting nature of computer programming seems to lend itself well to a 
logic-based learning approach, we ask whether the paradigm of Inductive Logic 
Programming (ILP)\cite{muggleton94} is well-suited to solve this problem. More 
specifically, our working implementation consists of an Answer Set Program run using 
tools from the Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection\cite{potassco} (see 
section~\ref{sec:asp}, Answer Set Programming).

\subsection{Answer Set Programming} \label{sec:asp}

Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a form of logic programming particularly suited to 
search problems over large domains (such as the domain of all imperative programs of a 
given length). An Answer Set Program distinguishes the result to be computed by a set 
of propositional facts and rules in the domain. Importantly, ASP includes 
\emph{negation as failure}, where a rule can be conditional on the inability of prove 
that some proposition is true, which allows \emph{non-monotonic reasoning}. The result 
of running an ASP is an \emph{answer set} of facts which is consistent with the 
program, forms a \emph{stable model}, and is minimal in a certain sense. For further 
details, see \cite{glimpse}, which gives a concise introduction to the paradigm.

ASP was used by Muggleton et al.\ in 2014\cite{metagol} in their work on grammatical 
inference:
