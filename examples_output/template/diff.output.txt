The following template was specified:
[Program vars: x y z; Logic vars: x0 y0]
   1. pre: X > Y, X0=X, Y0=Y.
   2. mid: X=Y0, Y=X0.
   3. post: X = X0-Y0, X > 0.

Which was expanded into the following 'normal' form:
[Program vars: x y z; Logic vars: x0 y0]
   1. pre: X > Y, X0=X, Y0=Y.
   2. mid: X=Y0, Y=X0.
   3. post: X = X0-Y0, X > 0.

Which was further expanded into the following 'complete' form:
[Program vars: x y z; Logic vars: x0 x1 y0 y1]
   1. pre: X > Y, X0=X, Y0=Y, X1=X, Y1=Y.
   2. mid: X=Y0, Y=X0, X1 > Y1, X0=X1, Y0=Y1.
   3. post: X = X0-Y0, X > 0.

Synthesising the program fragment between conditions:
   Pre:  X > Y, X0=X, Y0=Y, X1=X, Y1=Y.
   Post: X=Y0, Y=X0, X1 > Y1, X0=X1, Y0=Y1.
