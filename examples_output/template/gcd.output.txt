The following template was specified:
[Program vars: g x y; Logic vars: gg]
   1. pre: X+Y>0, gcd(X,Y,Gg).
   2. while (y > 0):
   3.     inv: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0.
   4.     var: Y; decreasing.
   5. end_while
   6. post: G=Gg.

Which was expanded into the following 'normal' form:
[Program vars: g x y; Logic vars: gg v0 v1]
   1. pre: X+Y>0, gcd(X,Y,Gg).
   2. mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0.
   3. while (y > 0):
   4.     mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0, V0=Y, Y>0.
   5.     mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0, V1=Y, V1<V0.
   6. end_while
   7. mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0, Y<=0.
   8. post: G=Gg.

Which was further expanded into the following 'complete' form:
[Program vars: g x y; Logic vars: gg v0 v1 x0 y0]
   1. pre: X+Y>0, gcd(X,Y,Gg), X0=X, Y0=Y.
   2. mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0.
   3. while (y > 0):
   4.     mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0, V0=Y, Y>0, X0+Y0>0, gcd(X0,Y0,Gg).
   5.     mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0, V1=Y, V1<V0.
   6. end_while
   7. mid: gcd(X,Y,Gg), X+Y>0, Y<=0, X0+Y0>0, gcd(X0,Y0,Gg).
   8. post: G=Gg.
