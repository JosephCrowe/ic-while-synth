This is my final-year undergraduate project at Imperial College London's Department of Computing, supervised by Krysia Broda and Mark Law.

Answer Set Programming (currently using a tool called clingo) is used to learn programs in a simple imperative language with if-statements and while-loops, using a set of test examples giving (input, output) pairs.
