main/
    The source code of the main programs forming the project.

old/
    Abandoned or experimental code that is kept for historical interest.

examples/iterative/
    Example specification files that can be run with IterativeLearn.hs.

examples/learn/
    Example specification files that can be run with `learn'.

examples/run/
    Example programs encoded in the format used by run.lp and learn.lp. They can be 
    executed by running with using Clingo 3 together with run.lp. Most already include 
    instances of in/3 to give input values, and some also use an #include statement  
    for run.lp so that they can be run with Clingo 3 alone.

main/IterativeLearn.hs
    The program that performs synthesis of while programs from specification files such 
    as can be found in examples/iterative. IterativeLearn.hs can be run as a script
    on UNIX if GHC or Hugs is installed and "runhaskell" is present on the system path. 
    Alternatively, it can be executed using Hugs or compiled with GHC and run as a 
    binary.
    
    You must change your directory to main/ before running IterativeLearn.hs as a 
    script; then, the syntax is:
    
    `./IterativeLearn.hs SPEC_FILE_NAME'.

main/Format.hs
main/format
    A program that filters its standard input, detecting any occurrence of a set of 
    line_instr/2 facts in the format Clingo 3 would output, and printing this out as a 
    human-readable program listing, printing out any other facts on the same line 
    separately, and copying any other lines.
    
    It is occasionally useful when you have some line_instr/2 facts and want to see 
    what program they represent to run main/format, then paste them in and press Ctrl+D 
    to issue an end-of-file, so that the program is printed out.

main/Learn.hs
main/learn
    The previous incarnation of IterativeLearn.hs, and, respectively, a shell script 
    that performs some processing to allow it to be called from a directory other than 
    main/, and also pipes it through main/format. Requires Clingo 3 to be on the system 
    path as "clingo." Now obsolete.

main/learn.lp
    An ASP that synthesises programs from a list of input/output examples.

main/run.lp
    An ASP that simulates the running of programs given their represenation and some 
    input values.

main/counterexample.lp
    An ASP that, when relevant facts and rules (which must be dynamically computed) are 
    added by IterativeLearn.hs, produces a counterexample for a given program and set 
    of conditions, if one exists.

main/While.hs
main/Clingo.hs
    Libraries used by the other Haskell programs.
